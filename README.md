# SAIT Projects, Exercises and Assignments

A single repository combining various HTML and JS assignments from SAIT. Pretty much everything that can be served up easily via github pages.

There were also two php / Laravel projects. Those are hosted separately. Please have a look at https://wakely.ca for a look at those.
